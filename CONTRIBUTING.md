# Contributing

Work on `dev`. `main` takes a merge from `dev` with `--no-ff`.

Write conventional commits. The commitizen hook rejects a message that does not
follow the format.

Install the hooks in this repository:

```bash
pre-commit install --install-hooks -t pre-commit -t commit-msg -t pre-push
```

Plain `pre-commit install` installs the pre-commit stage alone, and the commit
message and branch hooks then do not run. CI runs the pre-commit stage hooks on
a push and on a pull request to `main` or `dev`.

Every GitHub action is pinned to a commit SHA. Dependabot updates the actions
and the hook revisions weekly against `dev`. `pinact run -u` updates and
re-pins the actions by hand.

## Releases

A release is a merge of `dev` into `main`, then an annotated tag on the merge
and `git push --follow-tags`. The `release` workflow turns every pushed tag into
a GitHub release. GitHub writes its notes: the pull requests merged since the
previous release and a link that compares the two tags.

A tag names the ntfy version that the release deploys, such as `2.28.0`. A later
release on the same version adds a counter: `2.28.0-1`, `2.28.0-2`.

## House style

A comment says why, never what. Longer reasoning belongs in the README of the
repository that owns the code. Write the prose in Simplified Technical English:
short sentences, one meaning per word, and the condition before the command.
